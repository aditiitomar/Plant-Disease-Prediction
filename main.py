### Introduction
Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System, a cutting-edge project developed for our final year project. Our system aims to assist in the efficient identification of plant diseases. By uploading an image of a plant, our system can quickly analyze it to detect any signs of diseases, helping to protect crops and ensure a healthier harvest.
     
### Team Members
- Aditi Tomar (Roll No. 12345)
- Ansh Agarwal (Roll No. 23456)
- Atul (Roll No. 34567)
- Ankit Bisht (Roll No. 45678)
    
### How It Works
- **Upload Image:** Navigate to the **Prediction** page and upload an image of a plant showing symptoms of disease.
- **Analysis:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to process the image and identify potential diseases.
- **Results:** View detailed results and receive recommendations for further action.

### Features
- **Accuracy:** Our system employs advanced machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
- **User-Friendly:** Enjoy a simple and intuitive interface designed for a seamless user experience.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, enabling quick decision-making in the field.

### Dataset    
This dataset is part of a crowdsourcing effort to leverage smartphone technology and machine learning for improving food production by addressing the issue of infectious diseases in crops.
- Size: Over 50,000 expertly curated images.
- Content: The images consist of healthy and infected leaves of crop plants.
- Platform: The dataset is released on the PlantVillage online platform.
- Purpose: The dataset is intended to facilitate the development of mobile disease diagnostics using machine learning and crowdsourcing.
- Goal: The goal is to use computer vision approaches to address yield losses in crop plants caused by infectious diseases.
